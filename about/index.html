title: About Siwapp
---
<p class="lead">We like it free, simple, open source.</p>

<p>That's why we started developing siwapp. Siwapp is not meant to solve every single need of your business, neither it intends to end up as a full business manager application.</p>

<p>Our goal is to get just one thing right: Invoices. A basic need for every business.</p>

<p>This web application will also be able to work as a module -interconnected through its API- to many other business management applications which takes care -the easy way- only of the billing of the company.</p>

<p>Siwapp is built on Symfony, a PHP web development environment, which heavily rests on MVC ideas (model, view, controller). This environment allows us to develop "Extreme Programming" techniques, as well as guarantee a proper application evolution in the future.</p>

<p>Siwapp's development is maintained by MARKHAUS, an Internet company with more than 10 years of expertise in the online world, but everybody is welcome to get involved!</p>
